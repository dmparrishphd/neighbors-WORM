Description:
                Given a first numeric vector sequence and a
                second numeric vector, find values in the first
                that are nearest each of the values in the
                second, in either the "left" (decreasing) or
                "right" (increasing) directions.

Usage:
                neighbors <- source ( "filepath" ) [[ 1 ]] ()
                neighbors(X, x, direction = c ("left", "right"))
Arguments:
                X:  a monotonically increasing, numeric vector
                    sequence
                x:  a numeric vector
Value:
                An `integer` `vector` with one element for each
                element of (little) `x`. The values of the
                return are the indices of (big) `X` which are
                the "left" or "right" neighbors of (little) `x`,
                depending on the `direction` argument. Some
                elements of the return may be NA, e.g., if there
                is no element of (big) `X` to the "left" of an
                element of (little) `x`.
Examples:
                filepath.neighbors <- paste0 (
                    # INSERT FILEPATH PREFIX
                    "/o2355636052750274503751046546230470434335367" ,
                    "/neighbors.R" )
                neighbors <- source ( filepath.neighbors ) [[ 1 ]]
                # IF (BIG) `X` IS A SEQUENCE OF CONSECUTIVE
                # INTEGERS BEGINNING AT 1, neighbors IS SIMILAR
                # TO ROUNDING DOWN TO THE NEAREST INTEGER.
                neighbors(1:9, c(exp(1) , pi))
                # NO ELEMENT OF (BIG) `X` IS TO THE LEFT OF -Inf:---
                neighbors(X = 1:9, x = c(-Inf, Inf))
                # NO ELEMENT OF (BIG) `X` IS TO THE RIGHT OF Inf:---
                neighbors(X = 1:9, x = c(-Inf, Inf), direction = "right")
